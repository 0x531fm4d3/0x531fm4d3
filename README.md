Hi, my name is Amit Moses, with 5+ years of expirience in the cybersecurity field.
I ocassionaly upload scripts that can be used for SOC's to reduce manual work and service SLA.
Naturally, the scripts are written for platforms that are used/were used by me.

Other than that, I find Windows internals and malware analysis facsinating.
My goal is to eventually write code that may assist myself and others on these subjects.
Hope you will find my scripts useful.

Feel free to reach me out on linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/amitmoses
